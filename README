--------
OVERVIEW
--------

The PyReshaper package is a Python-based package for performing time-slice
to time-series convertion of NetCDF files, compliant with the CF 1.6 
Conventions.  The PyReshaper package is designed to run in parallel to
maximize performance, with the parallelism implemented over variables
(i.e., task parallelism).  This means that the maximum parallelism
achieveable for a given operation is one core/processor per variables in
the time-slice NetCDF files.

------------
DEPENDENCIES
------------

The PyReshaper directly depends upon the PyNIO and mpi4py packages.  Access
and manipulation of the NetCDF files is done through PyNIO, and the parallelism
is implimented directly with mpi4py.  Implicit dependencies exists, as PyNIO
has its own dependencies (netCDF4 and numpy) as does mpi4py (numpy and MPI).

Currently these dependencies are known to be:

PyNIO (>=1.4.1)
mpi4py (>=1.3)

The version requirements have not been rigidly tested, so earlier versions
may actually work.  No version requirement is made during installation, though,
so problems might occur if an earlier versions of these packages have been
installed.

BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------

See the file called INSTALL for more instructions on building and installing
the PyReshaper package.
